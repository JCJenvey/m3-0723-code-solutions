## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What are props in React?

- How do you declare and access props in a component?

- How do you pass props to a component?

- How do you write JavaScript expressions in JSX?

## Notes

1. Props are information you can pass to a JSX tag
2. Props can be declared as variables or passed directly into a component. They are read by passing them as a parameter of the component function using the {} destructuring syntax
3. Props are passed to a component the same way attributes are added to a HTML tag
4. An expression can be placed to assign a default value to a prop when destructuring, or can be placed at any point before the return statement.
